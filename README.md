### Parallel Background ReFrameWork Template ###
**Robotic Enterprise Framework**

For Processes that dont need to interact with the Ui can parallize work which has do be done.
This is meant to be for bacckground processing but it can be used to automate UiÂ´s if the process is build context aware.

This ist still an early stage. The Documentation need to be wriiten asd well.

#### Credits ####
- UiPath for providing the RE-Framework
- Max (co-worker from cronos) to bring this idea into my mind
